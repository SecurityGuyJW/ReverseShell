# Project Title

The Reverse Shell 

## How it works

This script returns a reverse shell to the console of the user.

1. Typing python reverseShell -t 192.168.1.1 -p 5000 -c, starts a server on port 5000 witch will return a shell upon connection.

2. Typing python reverseShell -t 192.168.1.1 -p 5000, will connect the client into the listening server.

3. Once the client is connected the client will send commands to the server.

4. The server will then return its output to the client Shell.

5. A working internet connection is required to perform the transfer.

6. To close the connection xxx.
